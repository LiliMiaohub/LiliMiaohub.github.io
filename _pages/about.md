Hey! I am a PhD student at [Indiana University](https://bloomington.iu.edu/) [School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/) (Luddy). My research investigates the interactions between science, technology, and society, focusing on three main threads: (i) the driving forces behind regional knowledge production capacity and how science and innovation can be leveraged to reduce regional economic inequality; (ii) the funding investment behind global science and the associated benefits and risks of foreign scientific investment; and (iii) how political events—such as Brexit and China's Belt and Road Initiative—have influenced national scientific development and global cooperation.

I am a recipient of several awards, including the [Humane Studies Fellowship](https://www.theihs.org/funding-opportunities/humane-studies-fellowship/) and the Excellence in Research (2022) award from the Luddy School.
